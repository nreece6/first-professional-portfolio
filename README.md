Professional Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my first professional portfolio created without starter code. 

This project was created as a way of combining the HTML and CSS knowledge I have gained over my first two weeks of learning to become a web developer. This build is to give me a template to build upon for more reactive and funcional projects in the future, as well as to test my knowledge gaines. I built responsive functionality into the site with CSS and learned about FlexBox.

This project serves as my first full landing page I have ever built solo. I look forward to continuing to build upon the skills and knowledge gained here.
